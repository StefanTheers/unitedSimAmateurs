\usage{
simTournamentPerm(
  lineups,
  reps = 100,
  ncores = 8,
  sample = TRUE,
  sample.size = 100,
  method = "sample",
  repsGame = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lineups}{[\code{matrix}]\cr
(\code{N} x 5)-dim. matrix of lineups where \code{N}=2,4,8,16, ...
Column names are t,a,v,m,s.
Row names are the teams.}

\item{reps}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
number of replications of the single tournament}

\item{ncores}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
number of processor cores for parallelization}

\item{sample}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should a sample of possible tournament draws be used?
If \code{FALSE}, then all possible draws are used (which might be computationally infeasible
for more than 8 participating teams).}

\item{sample.size}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
the number of tournament draw samples drawn if \code{sample=TRUE}.}

\item{method}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
either \code{"expected"} or \code{"sample"} (default).
More details in \code{\link{game}}.}

\item{repsGame}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
number of repetitions of each game (if \code{method="sample"}).
Default is 1 (i.e. no repetitions). \code{repsGame} > 1 is NOT recommended for tournaments.}
}
\value{
list of S3 class \code{"simResult"} with:
\describe{
  \item{\code{results}}{  [\code{data.table}]\cr results of every game }
  \item{\code{summary}}{  [\code{data.table}]\cr points won by the teams }
  \item{\code{lineups}}{  [\code{matrix}]\cr the \code{lineups} input parameter matrix }

\description{
Simulation of a tournament without fixed lineups, i.e. allowing for
permutations of the lineup matrix.

\note{
Note that (A:B, C:D) and (D:C, B:A) etc. are the same tournament!

\examples{
# define some lineups:
lineups <- cbind(t = c(4,0,0,4), a = c(0,4,4,0), v = c(5,5,8,8), m = c(8,5,5,5), s = c(5,8,5,5))
rownames(lineups) <- c("Nob", "FdS", "USV", "Marco")
lineups
lineups2 <- rbind(lineups, lineups)
rownames(lineups2) <- paste0(rownames(lineups), c(rep("", 4), rep(" II", 4)))
lineups2

# run the simulation (with all possible lineups permutations):
set.seed(2020)
res <- simTournamentPerm(lineups, reps = 3, ncores = 8, sample = FALSE, sample.size = 100, method = "sample")
res
names(res)

res$results
# These are the results of all games that were played in all tournaments.
# tournamentID = (#lineup permutation - #repetition of this very same tournament)
# FT = full time, ET = extra time, Pen = penalty shoot-out

res$summary
# The main simulation results with estimators for:
# * pointsAvg:
#   number of points awarded to the teams in 1 tournament:
#   1 point = 1 game won. For 4 teams, each team has
#   played 2 games, i.e. 3 points are awarded in total and the
#   tournament winner gets 2, the losing finalist 1, the other two 0.
# * wonNumber:
#   total number of tournaments that were won, i.e. in [0, reps * sample.size].
# * wonProp:
#   wonNumber / (reps * number of permutations), i.e. proportion of tournaments won.
#   If sample=TRUE,  number of permutations = sample.size.
#   If sample=FALSE, number of permutations = factorial(number of teams).

res$lineups
# the team's lineups

res$resultsTournament[1:2]
# list of reps-times repeated tournaments for the first two lineups' permutations

res$summary[, sum(pointsAvg)]   # = number of points awarded in each tournament
res$summary[, sum(wonNumber)]   # = reps * number of permutations = number of tournaments played
res$summary[, sum(wonProp)]     # = 1 = 100\%

res
# The print method is called here.
# Nob is the overall best team with 1.31 points per tournament.
# Nob also won 63\% of all tournaments that were played.


# Run the simulation again (with 100 sampled lineups permuations):
set.seed(2020)
system.time(res <- simTournamentPerm(lineups, reps = 3, ncores = 8, sample = TRUE, sample.size = 100, method = "sample"))
res


# Increasing the number of teams (4 to 8) would make the simulation much slower if
# sample=FALSE was chosen:
set.seed(2020)
system.time(res <- simTournamentPerm(lineups2, reps = 3, ncores = 8, sample = TRUE, sample.size = 100, method = "sample"))
res


# Another look at the sample and methods inputs:
# * 4 teams participate in the tournaments.
# * factorial(4) possible lineups permutations (i.e. different tournaments) are possible.
# * Every tournament is played 5 times (if method="sample") or once (if method="expected").
# * As there are 4 teams participating in each tournament, 2 semi-finals plus 1 final are
#   played. Alltogether that's 3 games per tournament to determine the winner.
# * If method="sample", we sample 100 row permutations of the lineups matrix out of
#   factorial(4) possible permutations (with repetition).
